## My process
 - I first though about whether to use Flexbox or CSS Grid for the layout of the information
 - I then started working on the HTML to figure out all the components I needed
 - I then worked on the CSS portion and figured out how to organize the layout of the project

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was my first time using CSS Grid so I initially ran into a lot of trouble with how CSS Grid itself worked (such as grid-template etc.). It helped to get out a piece of paper and sort how I wanted to layout the page before I dived into styling the HTML using CSS. 

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to continue figuring out how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox. I want to work on more projects that allow me to utilize both so I can deepen my understanding for both. I also would like to continue learning more about how to use margins/padding etc. to better layout my projects. Also, I would like to work on making my work less redundant in terms of making my CSS cleaner and easier to read. I think there are times where I could simplify the CSS by applying the style to multiple elements, but am not entirely sure how to do that yet, and hence, end up applying a style individually to elements. 

### Useful resources

- [Responsive CSS Grid Code Pen Example](https://codepen.io/angeladelise/pen/YzXLdyq) - This resource allowed me to contextualize how CSS Grid works
